# Jambo Mono Fonts

[Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka)-derived fonts intended to
closely match the Ubuntu Mono fonts, including [Nerd
fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) patched variants.

## Alterations

1. `$` - vertical line through the center.
2. `Â¢` - vertical line through the center.
3. `0` - diagonal line across the middle instead of a dot.
4. `9` and `6` - curl the bottom/top (helps with hinting at lower sizes).
5. `{` and `}` - make curlier.

See below for a comparison between Jambo ('turquoise') and the original Ubuntu
('coral'):

Patched against Nerd fonts v2.3.3 (03/10/2023).

## Installation

The `install` script will install the font in either
`${HOME}/.local/share/fonts` or `/usr/local/share/fonts`, depending on whether
the user is root or not. Run:
```bash
./install
```

## Usage

The fonts use the family name `Jambo Mono`, with each file corresponding to
`Regular`, `Bold`, `Italic`, and `Bold Italic` styles. Should these fonts be
too thin, use `Medium` instead of regular and `Heavy` instead of `Bold`.

## Building

### Iosevka

The configuration file used to generate all the fonts is available in `src/`.
It was used to build using Iosevka 19.0.1.

The `jambo-mono` build plan corresponds to the TTF files in this repository,
and the `jambo-mono-tall` rules will build a variant with slightly taller
capitals and numerals at larger font sizes.

To run, first install TTF autohinter. Then, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka.git iosevka
cd iosevka
npm i
npm run build -- contents::jambo-mono
```

Use `contets::jambo-mono-tall` for the tall variant, and `--jCmd=<n>` to run
`n` threads in parallel. The files will be found in `dist/`. To apply the Nerd
Font patch set, look at its online documentation.

### Nerd patching

To patch the nerd font set, first download the font-patcher script from Nerd
fonts and install fontforge. Then, in the `dist/` directory in the Iosevka
repository, run:
```sh
DIRS=(jambo-mono/ttf jambo-mono/ttf-unhinted)
for DIR in "${DIRS[@]}"; do
  for FONT in "${DIR}"/*.ttf; do
    fontforge \
      -script <path/to/font-patcher> -q -l -c -w --careful \
      -out "${DIR}-nerd" "${FONT}"
  done
done
```

Be sure to substitute `<path/to/font-patcher>` with the relative path to the
Nerd `font-patcher` script.
